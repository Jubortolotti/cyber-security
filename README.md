Estudos, anotações e pratica de Cyber Security content

I am a creative and adaptable professional who sees cybersecurity as a meaningful opportunity to use technology to protect people and organizations. I’m strongly analytical and persistent, which helps me identify patterns, investigate anomalies, and ensure that critical details are never overlooked.

I work well with structure and rules, but I’m also flexible enough to adapt to fast-changing threats and new technologies. My goal as a cybersecurity analyst—especially in SOC environments—is to strengthen security controls, respond effectively to incidents, and contribute to safer digital experiences for users and businesses.
